# Updates
Oh, hey look at that the first update....
The GitHub and Networking Edition!
NEW FEATURES:
1. GitHub meaning it's open source!
2. NETWORKING!!!! Finally you can see(and jump off) your friends cub- I mean platforms, with this you can build houses and mess around. Trust me, best update ever... wait also worst since it's the first, hmm.






Quick disclamer: If you are making a networked mod DO NOT use the values 69, 70, 71, 72. These will mess with the AirJump mod a lot and idk but MIGHT crash it, if I find out that people are doing this I may have to remove networking.
