# AirJump
AirJump is a mod that lets you spawn platforms underneeth your hands.
Quick disclamer: If you are making a networked mod DO NOT use the values 69, 70, 71, 72. These will mess with the AirJump mod a lot and idk but MIGHT crash it, if I find out that people are doing this I may have to remove networking.
Yeah that's it lol, how to use:
1. Press grip buttons to make platforms
2. ... that's it
