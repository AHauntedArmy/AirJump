# Updates
Oh hey look at that, the first update....
GitHub and Networking? Edition :O
NEW FEATURES:
* GitHub meaning it's open source!
* NETWORKING!!!! Finally you can see(and jump off) your friends boxes, with this you can build houses and mess around. Very fun :)
* AirJump is now WAY more optimized... I think
* Fixed bug spamming errors in the console.






Quick disclamer: If you are making a networked mod DO NOT use the values 69, 70, 71, 72. These will mess with the AirJump mod a lot and idk but MIGHT crash it, if I find out that people are doing this I may have to remove networking.
