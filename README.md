# AirJump
A funnie mod for Gorilla Tag
that makes platforms underneath your hands that you can jump off.
This is a mod originally published in
Gorilla Tag Modding Discord https://discord.gg/monkemod
But now I have decided to set up a GitHub for it and make it open source.
If you mod this to be able to use this in public lobbies your a cringe monke.

How2AirJump:
- Be in a private lobby
- Use grip buttons to spawn in block underneath hands
- Jump off platform to be monke
