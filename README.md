# Updates
Update 1: Networking and GitHub
* AirJump Official Oculus Quest Port.
* GitHub meaning it's open source.
* NETWORKING! Finally you can see(and jump off) your friends boxes, with this you can build houses and mess around. Very fun :)
* Fixed bug spamming errors in the console.
* Fixed bug where if you kept holding grip while going into a public lobby the platform would stay.
* Other minor tweaks that should make the experience a little better.






If you are making a networked mod, please don't use the RaiseEvent values 69, 70, 71, 72.
