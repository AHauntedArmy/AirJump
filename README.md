# Updates
Update 1: Networking and GitHub
* GitHub meaning it's open source!
* NETWORKING!!!! Finally you can see(and jump off) your friends boxes, with this you can build houses and mess around. Very fun :)
* Fixed bug spamming errors in the console.
* Fixed bug where if you kept holding grip while going into a public lobby the platform would stay.
* Other minor tweaks that should make the experience a little better.






Quick disclamer: If you are making a networked mod DO NOT use the values 69, 70, 71, 72. These will mess with the AirJump mod a lot and idk but MIGHT crash it, if I find out that people are doing this I may have to remove networking.
